# microdata-template
An implementation of HTML template by way of the microdata mechanism. 
### Simple Usage
### Explanation
The [HTML5 Recommendations](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/scripting-1.html#the-template-element) designate the `<template>` element as a hidden node containing some fragment of markup. That markup is intended as the source structure for a script to clone and then customize and deposit elsewhere in the HTML document. An advantage of this technology is that HTML structures can be plainly constructed in manifest markup rather than assembled on-the-fly from within the logic of a script. This can be especially advantagous when the resulting assembly is deep or elaborate. WebPlatform.org has a concise explanation of [how to employ the template element](https://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/html/elements/template).

**Unfortunately**, even though the `<template>` element is a specified recommendation of HTML5, it is not fully supported in all popular browsers (as of this writing), so certain accommodations must be made, especially to assure that the browser recognizes the element as valid node name and that its content should not be rendered by default. These accommodations can be made quite simply by declaring an appropriate namespace in the HTML and CSS documents (at least "http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"), and by also declaring the CSS rule: `template { display: none; }`. Alternatively, the [hidden attribute](http://caniuse.com/#search=hidden) can be added for assurance in most modern browsers `<template hidden></template>`.  

**Regardless**, even when the `<template>` is used as intended, and even if the browser supports it, a considerable amount of scripted logic can be required to traverse the cloned structure to locate particular nodes of a certain heirarchy into which specific data should be deposited. Essentially, the JavaScript must have an awareness of the templated markup, and this means that every change in markup structure necessitates a corresponding adjustment of the scripted routine. A solution for this is to prescribe *tokens* within the templated markup that the script can leverage as identity and location for which variable value to insert and where. This is the solution provided by popular templating libraries like [Mustache](https://mustache.github.io/), [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/), and [WebComponents](http://webcomponents.org/articles/introduction-to-template-element/).

**However*, even though those libraries are awesome and have many useful features, their use can necessitate some departure from the true intent of the `<template>` methodology, lull the markup away from validity, and require JavaScript that adheres to somewhat esoteric methodology. Seemingly, the `<template>` specification falls so short of the demand for this sort of popular want and need that every framework and library employs its own templating methodology as a core component of its offering. Which to choose?
